A new website has recently been created for the website https://www.cheesecannabisseeds.co.uk/ - They are a specialist seedbank for cannabis seeds that include the Cheese strain.

For new shoppers looking for seeds getting the right strains will require a little bit of trial and error. If you can find a good website, you should try to read about the strains that are available and try to find out what characteristics they have. Then, if you know that you want to breed them yourself, you will need to do some research on the specific characteristics of each plant to ensure that you are getting the right strain. It might be possible to grow specific strains, and then just use clones of them to create stronger strains. This could be possible, but you should first test the environment and make sure that the plant won't take over. Once you have an established environment and the right plants, you will be able to experiment with different strains to get the best strains.
